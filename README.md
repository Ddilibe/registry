A modern, responsive, and reusable UI component library built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project serves as a practical demonstration of building scalable and maintainable front-end components using a modern technology stack, including Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.

## ✨ Features

-   **Responsive Floating Header**: A sleek header component that transitions its appearance on scroll, fully responsive for both desktop and mobile views.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React 19, Vite for lightning-fast development, and TypeScript for robust type safety.
-   **Utility-First Styling**: Leverages Tailwind CSS and `class-variance-authority` for a highly customizable and maintainable styling system.
-   **Reusable Button Component**: A versatile `<Button>` component with multiple variants and sizes, built following best practices with Radix UI Slot.
-   **Scalable Architecture**: Organized with a clear directory structure for components, utilities, and registry definitions, making it easy to extend.
-   **Strict Code Quality**: Enforced through a comprehensive ESLint and TypeScript configuration to ensure clean and error-free code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or a compatible package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/registry.git
    cd registry
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application in action.

## 💻 Usage

The primary component showcased in this registry is the `FloatingHeader`. You can find its implementation at `src/registry/headers/floating-header/floating-header.tsx`.

To integrate it into a page, simply import and render it:

```tsx
import FloatingHeader from '@/registry/headers/floating-header/floating-header';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <FloatingHeader />
      <main>
        {/* Your page content here */}
      </main>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The header is designed to be placed at the top of your application layout. It automatically handles its floating and background-blur effects based on the user's scroll position.
