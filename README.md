# 🚀 Modern React Application Starter Kit

## Overview
This project serves as a robust and efficient starter kit for building modern web applications, leveraging the power of React 19, Vite, and TypeScript. It is meticulously configured with Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling and integrates `shadcn/ui` components to accelerate UI development, providing a solid foundation for scalable and maintainable frontend projects. ⚛️✨

## Features
-   **Cutting-Edge Frontend Stack**: Utilizes React 19 for a declarative user interface, Vite for blazing-fast development and optimized builds, and TypeScript for enhanced code quality and type-safety.
-   **Utility-First Styling**: Incorporates Tailwind CSS to enable rapid and consistent UI development through a highly customizable utility-first approach, complemented by `tw-animate-css` for seamless animations.
-   **Reusable UI Components**: Pre-configured for `shadcn/ui`, offering a comprehensive collection of accessible and customizable UI components built on Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS.
-   **Optimized Developer Experience**: Features hot module replacement (HMR) for instant feedback during development, efficient bundling, and robust ESLint and TypeScript configurations for maintaining high code quality.
-   **Modular Architecture**: Organizes the codebase with a clear `src` directory structure and path aliases, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended) and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  ### Clone the Repository
    Start by cloning the project repository to your local file system:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Ddilibe/registry.git
    cd registry
    ```
    
2.  ### Install Dependencies
    Navigate into the project directory and install all necessary dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables
This project does not require any specific environment variables to run locally as a standalone frontend application. If you integrate with a backend API, you might need to add `.env` files for API URLs or keys, for example:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## Usage
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server:

1.  ### Run the Development Server
    Execute the following command to start the Vite development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
2.  ### Access the Application
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address indicated in your terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`). You will see the default Vite + React application page, which includes the Vite and React logos, a counter button, and instructions for editing `src/App.tsx`.
